# WindowsOpSecTools
Tools for improving opsec on Windows 10 (as much as possible)

### This project is currently a work in progress! Most of the features are not yet implemented.

It is always recommended to switch to a Linux-based or other freedom-respecting operaing system for better security and privacy, however there are some cases where this is not possible. While gaming has seen a drastic improvement on linux recently, much of the proprietary professional software, Photo/Video Editors, CAD Software, Digital Audio Workstations, etc., do not have viable free software alternatives and probably won't for a long time. Furthermore most software like this won't run properly under Wine, thus the user is forced to use Windows whether it be on bare-metal or in a virtual machine.

These tools are a set of mitigations for Microsoft's telemetry and restrictions on Windows 10. Here is what is included or planned:
* Debloat Scripts
* Hardening Scripts
* Registry Tweaks
* Windows Update Replacements
* Custom Code Signing Tools
* Custom Kernel Signers Driver
* Product Policy Editor

Notes:
* These tools may be installed as a suite or used portably. All of the tweaks can be enabled independently.
* Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB or Windows Server is recommended.
* These tools do not guarantee your privacy. They are just band-aids. Again, use Linux wherever possible.
* The authors are not responsible for any inconvenience or data loss caused by these tools.
